## Resources
- [HOWTO Fetch Internet Resources Using urllib Package](<URL>)
- [Quickstart with Requests package](<URL>)
- [Requests package](<URL>)

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following without Google's help:
- How to fetch internet resources with the Python package `urllib`
- How to decode `urllib` body response
- How to use the Python package `requests` (`#requestsiswaysimplerthanurllib`)
- How to make HTTP GET requests
- How to make HTTP POST/PUT/etc. requests
- How to fetch JSON resources
- How to manipulate data from an external service

## Copyright - Plagiarism
- Solutions for the tasks are expected to be developed independently to meet the learning objectives.
- Plagiarism is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program.
- Publishing any content of this project is not allowed.

## Requirements
### General
- **Allowed Editors:** vi, vim, emacs
- **Interpreter/Compiler:** Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3 (version 3.8.5)
- **Line Endings:** All files should end with a new line
- **Shebang Line:** The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`

### Files and Directories
- A `README.md` file at the root of the repo, containing a description of the repository.
- All your files must be executable.

### Code Style
- Code should follow the `pycodestyle` guidelines (version 2.8.*).

### Documentation
- All modules should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`).
- Use `get` to access dictionary values by key.
- Documentation should be real sentences explaining the purpose of the module, class, or method.

### Execution
- Code should not be executed when imported (use `if __name__ == "__main__":`).

### Length
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`.
