# 0x09. Python - Everything is object

## Overview
* Language: Python
* Topics: OOP, Objects, Classes, Assignment, Aliasing, Mutability, Immutable, Reference, Identity, Variables, Memory Address
* Project due: November 1, 2023, 6:00 AM

## Project Description
This project focuses on understanding the concept that everything in Python is an object. It delves into Python's behavior with different types of objects, mutability, and immutability. It also presents questions that require you to think and understand the logic behind Python's behavior in different scenarios. All answers should be concise and in a single line.

## Resources
- [9.10. Objects and values](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#objects-values)
- [9.11. Aliasing](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#objects-values)
- [Immutable vs mutable types](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#objects-values)
- [Mutation (Only this chapter)](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#objects-values)
- [9.12. Cloning lists](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#objects-values)
- [Python tuples: immutable but potentially changing](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#objects-values)

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the reasons behind Python's behavior with different types of objects
- Differentiate between mutable and immutable objects
- Comprehend the concepts of assignment, aliasing, and reference
- Identify identical and linked variables
- Display variable identifiers (memory addresses)
- Recognize built-in mutable and immutable types
- Understand how Python passes variables to functions
- Be capable of answering Python-specific questions in interviews
