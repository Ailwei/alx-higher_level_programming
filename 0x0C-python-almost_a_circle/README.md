- **Concepts:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- **Author:** Guillaume
- **Weight:** 1

## Project Schedule

- **Start Date:** Nov 9, 2023, 6:00 AM

- **Checker Release:** Nov 13, 2023, 6:00 PM

## Project Context

The "Almost a Circle" project is a crucial part of the Higher Level curriculum, designed to prepare you for the AirBnB project. It covers various Python concepts, including:

- Import
- Exceptions
- Class
- Private attribute
- Getter/Setter
- Class method
- Static method
- Inheritance
- Unittest
- Read/Write file

You will also explore:

- args and kwargs
- Serialization/Deserialization
- JSON

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without relying on Google:

- Unit testing and its implementation in a large project
- Serialization and deserialization of a Class
- Reading and writing JSON files
- Usage of *args and **kwargs
- Handling named arguments in a function

## Copyright - Plagiarism

- Strictly forbidden
- Violation results in removal from the program
- No publishing of project content

## Requirements

### Python Scripts

- Editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Interpreter: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- File Endings: All files should end with a new line
- Shebang: First line of all files should be `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- README: Mandatory at the project root
- Code Style: pycodestyle ([version 2.8.*](https://pypi.org/project/pycodestyle/))
- Executability: All files must be executable
- Length: Files will be tested using `wc`
- Documentation:
  - Modules: `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`
  - Classes: `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'`
  - Functions: `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'` and `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'`

### Python Unit Tests

- Editors: vi, vim, emacs
- File Endings: All files should end with a new line
- Folder Structure: Tests should be inside a folder named [tests](./tests)
- Unittest Module: Mandatory usage
- File Naming: Test files and folders should start with `test_`
- Organization: Mirror project structure in the [tests](./tests) folder
- Execution:
  - All tests: `python3 -m unittest discover tests`
  - File by file: `python3 -m unittest tests/test_models/test_base.py`

## Collaboration

- Strongly encouraged to work together on test cases to cover all edge cases.
