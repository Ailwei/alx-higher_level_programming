## Background Context

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a fundamental concept, and this project aims to introduce you to OOP in Python. Make sure to read the provided resources and experiment with OOP concepts to fully understand them.

**Resources:**

- [Object Oriented Programming](#) (Read everything until the paragraph “Inheritance” excluded. You do NOT have to learn about class attributes, classmethod, and staticmethod yet)
- [Object-Oriented Programming](#) (Please *be careful*: in most of the following paragraphs, the author shows things the way you should not use or write a class to help you better understand some concepts and how everything works in Python 3.)
- [Properties vs. Getters and Setters](#)
- [Learn to Program 9 : Object Oriented Programming](#)
- [Python Classes and Objects](#)
- [Object Oriented Programming](#)

## Learning Objectives

After completing this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without using Google:

### General

- Why Python programming is awesome
- What is OOP
- "First-class everything"
- What is a class
- What is an object and an instance
- The difference between a class and an object or instance
- What is an attribute
- How to use public, protected, and private attributes
- What is self
- What is a method
- The special `__init__` method and how to use it
- Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding
- What is a property
- The difference between an attribute and a property in Python
- The Pythonic way to write getters and setters in Python
- How to dynamically create arbitrary new attributes for existing instances of a class
- How to bind attributes to objects and classes
- What is the `__dict__` of a class and/or instance of a class and what does it contain
- How Python finds the attributes of an object or class
- How to use the `getattr` function

### Copyright - Plagiarism

- You are responsible for creating solutions for the project tasks to meet the learning objectives.
- Avoid copying and pasting someone else's work.
- Do not publish any project content.
- Plagiarism is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program.

## Requirements

### General

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.5
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory
- Your code should use pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`
- All your modules should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`)
- All your classes should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'`)
- All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)` and `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)`)
- A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining the purpose of the module, class, or method (the length of it will be verified)

### More Info

- Documentation is now mandatory! Each module, class, and method must contain docstrings as comments. Example Google Style Python Docstrings
